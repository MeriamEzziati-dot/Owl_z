TASK 1 : Add RA DEC in OWLZ

RA, DEC columns 1 and 2 of data candidates:
use od DC:
-LIKELIHOOD QSO
-LIKELIHOOD MLT
 ADD TO OBJ loop
 DONE
 
 Test, print (flux colums)
 

 PRofiling advice:
 
 
 loop over obj in MLT redundant, find a way to make all 3  MLT in one bid loop
 
 RA,DEC dependancy successful 
  test on probability on obj number 515 ( initial coord prob e-95, 250,40 test pq=e-90)
  
# TASK 2:  Profiling

Obj: merge MLT loops into 1

- Option one: keep same name variable and load them in  sed loops   ( Computing speeed negative)
- Option 2: change variable name and load only once outside general loops (memory usage too big )   (BETTER => chosen)


MLT fusion loops successs : code in dir Documents/GIT/


# TASK 3: Generate 1000 positions inside Euclid WIDE footprint 

steps: 

turn footprint into mask ( need google) (nope) just rand from ra,dec

flatten mask such as for each index i have access to (ra,dec)

chose randompy one cell

sleect randomly around that value 

input value 

do this 1000 times 

merge poistions with ids

SUCESS! pwd= /home/mezziati/Documents/These/Euclid.RA_dec_rand.py


# TASK 4: merge positions with purity 1000 sq degress catalogue

steps: 

remove all objects with 0 detections in EUCLID VIS NIR bands 

generate size< ra,dec for each obj within the surface

To do that: grid needs to be finer ' 2D interpolation 

then easy 

final size for purity= 7e8
initial grid size 5e4


Problem: i have no idea where my 1000 sq  catalgue 
to solve that I need avvess to the cluster: impossible to do from the train 

SO next: make the grid finer ! 

Interp 2 result 


Result: no interpolation needede just first taking randomlt the coordinates
then generating an array (ra,dec) of error between -1 and 1 and then addind them to the intial array

Success !

now find the purity catalogues when access to internet granted
